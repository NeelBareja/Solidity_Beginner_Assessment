# Token 

I have developed a token called BlackBones using the Solidity programming language. This program allows for comprehensive management of the coin, including functionalities such as monitoring the total supply, minting new tokens, and burning existing ones.


## Description

The Token, known as BlackBones (BB), is designed utilizing Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. This software allows for the generation and removal of coins, offering functionality for both minting and burning operations. Additionally, it provides insights into the total supply of the coin.


## Getting Started


### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste Token.sol into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Token.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Token" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Now at the left bottom side of the page there is section called as Deployed Contracts. below that as you can see contract is deployed and by clicking into TOKEN there are functions like burnCoin, mintCoin which will burn and mint coin respectively after that balances button will give balance of the address that you put into the text field right side of the button. further there are 3 more button which will give token name, its abbrevation and total supply.
